# Instructions for Claude

## Tests
- The entire test suite takes a long time to run. When verifying that changes
  work as expected, act in this order:
    1. Run individual relevant tests.
    2. Run individual relevant files.
    3. Run the entire test suite. (We should have high confidence that all
       tests will pass before performing this step.)
- Do not start more than one test run at a time.
